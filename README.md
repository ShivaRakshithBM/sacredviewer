# sacredviewer
A web frontend to IDSIA's Sacred for the FileStorage Observer. Since tensorboard only supports MongoDB Observer and my usage didn't allow for me to use it, I decided to put this together.

```
Usage: sacredviewer --rootdir=sacred_expt_folder
```

Warning: It's not very clean and just something I hacked together in a few hours. Will clean it up and add some features that I feel will be helpful in tracking my experiments. Suggestions/requests are welcome!
